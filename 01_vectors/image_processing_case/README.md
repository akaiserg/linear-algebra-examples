# Image Processing with Vector Subtraction

## Problem Statement
Image processing often involves comparing images, detecting changes, and analyzing differences. Vector subtraction is a fundamental operation for:

- **Change Detection**: Finding differences between two images
- **Edge Detection**: Identifying boundaries and transitions
- **Noise Reduction**: Removing unwanted variations
- **Image Enhancement**: Improving image quality

## Vector Subtraction Approach
In image processing, each pixel is represented as a vector (RGB values), and we use **vector subtraction** to:

1. **Compare Images**: `difference = image1 - image2`
2. **Detect Changes**: `change_vector = new_pixel - old_pixel`
3. **Calculate Errors**: `error = predicted_pixel - actual_pixel`
4. **Enhance Images**: `enhanced = original + correction_vector`

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Pixel Vectors**: RGB values as 3D vectors
- **Element-wise Subtraction**: `[R1, G1, B1] - [R2, G2, B2] = [R1-R2, G1-G2, B1-B2]`
- **Change Detection**: Using subtraction to find differences
- **Image Enhancement**: Adding/subtracting correction vectors
- **Error Analysis**: Measuring prediction accuracy
