# PCA Data Analysis with Span and Basis

## Problem Statement
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique in data science that uses span and basis concepts to:

- **Reduce dimensionality** of high-dimensional data
- **Find the most important directions** (principal components) in data
- **Visualize high-dimensional data** in lower dimensions
- **Remove noise** and focus on main patterns
- **Understand data structure** and relationships

## Span and Basis Approach
PCA works by finding a new basis (principal components) that:

1. **Spans the data space** efficiently
2. **Maximizes variance** in each direction
3. **Orders components** by importance
4. **Transforms data** to new coordinate system
5. **Reduces dimensions** while preserving information

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Eigenvectors as Basis**: Principal components are eigenvectors
- **Eigenvalues as Importance**: Larger eigenvalues = more important directions
- **Variance Maximization**: PCA finds directions with maximum variance
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Project data onto fewer dimensions
- **Data Transformation**: Change basis to see data differently

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how PCA uses span and basis concepts
- Learn to find principal components (new basis vectors)
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Visualize data in different coordinate systems
- Practice real-world data analysis techniques
